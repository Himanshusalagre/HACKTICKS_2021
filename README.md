For easy resource and time management, with the option of an amazing to-do list to organize schedules and a timer to limit breaks! Everything with one click at a time.

Aim is to build a Google Chrome Extension called "Short Minute" that will act as a single platform to:

    - Organize all our study and break schedules
    - All all the resources at one place
    - Manage the to-dos
    - Track the Progress of Work or  Study 
    - This Extension automatically suggests to the user some good resources (like Coursera Courses, Youtube Channels, articles etc.) 
    to start with their programming, coding  journey or Computer Science in broader aspects.
